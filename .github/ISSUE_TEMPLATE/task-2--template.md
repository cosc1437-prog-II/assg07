---

For this task, you are given working versions of `swap()` and `threeSort()`
that work on `int` types.  Overload these function but modify their signatures
to instead swap and sort `char` data types.

Perform the following steps for this task:

1. Enable the task 2 tests and create declarations and implementations
   of `swap()` and `threeSort()` functions.
2. You can copy and paste the existing versions to create your overloaded
   versions.  The only difference is that the functions need to operater
   on `char` references instead of `int` references like before.
3. This is the first time you were not given the function documentation.
   You should also copy the function documentation, but modify it to
   correctly document the type being manipulated in this overloaded version
   that works on character types.

**Suggested Solution**

These overloaded functions will be mostly identical to the previous
one you did that works on `int` type.  So it will probably be fastest
to copy the code for each function, and modify the type where necessary
to work on character types.  Don't forget to copy and update the
function documentation as well for these functions.

**Additional Requirements**

- You are required to overload the functions and change the signature
  so both operate on `char` data types.
- You are not given the function documentation this time, so you
  are required to copy the documentation and modify it appropriately for
  the functions that now operate on a different type.
